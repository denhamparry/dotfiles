# RESET

> Notes for things to check when re-installing Distro

## Git Repos

- Check a directory for all git repos via `gitreop` (in [aliases](./aliases))
- Create a local backup of all git repositories
  - This is several GB but absolute copy of work (and any deleted repos)
  - Also copies any `gitignored` files that I might be using
    - Should I make this a weekly backup process locally?
  - Look to write script to pull URLs of repos
- Check GPG key is available to transfer
